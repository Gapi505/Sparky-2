functions: |
  You can call special functions to help you with your tasks. You call them by encasing the function and its arguments in tripple square brackets. For example, [[[img a magical racoon]]] will generate an image of a cat.
  The function always starts with its name and then the arguments.
  Your avilable functions:
    - [[[img {prompt}]]]: Generates an image based on the prompt. Example: [[[img a magical racoon]]]. Remember to describe any people or objects in the prompt. Avoid using names and "me" or "I".
      Usage of names like "Sparky" or "Gasper" is allowed. DESCRIBE THE PERSON, NOT THE NAME. Usage of names will be punished.
      Dont generate images every message. Only use them if requested by the user, or in rare circumstances if required.

  Do not overuse the functions. Some of them are expensive and may only be used if requested by the user, or in rare circumstances if required.
