functions: |
  You can call special functions to help you with your tasks. You call them by encasing the function and its arguments in double square brackets. For example, [[img a magical racoon]] will generate an image of a cat.
  The funstion always starts with its name and then the arguments.
  Your avilable functions:
    - [[img {prompt}]]: Generates an image based on the prompt. Example: [[img a magical racoon]]

  Do not overuse the functions. Some of them are expensive and may only be used if requested by the user, or in rare circumstances if required.
