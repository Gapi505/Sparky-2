# Sparky 2
The original Sparky was a complete mess. I have now refactored the code to be more manageable.
Sparky 2.0 is now powered by the Llama 3 model. but can be changed easily because of the not so spaghetti like code which was present in the first version.

## Installation
To install you have to:
* Clone the repo
* Install the requirements:
  * pytorch (CUDA support recommended)
  * python-llama-cpp (Install with CUDA support. If you don't know how - look it up)
  * python-dotenv
  * discord
  * if errors show up install those too. I forgor which are installed by default
* create a .env with `BOT_TOKEN={your discord bot token}`
* run
